It's such a simple statement yet it carries so much meaning. You asked me why I love you here's why. I love you for you. I love you for the way you laugh, for your voice, for your ideals, for your personality, for your warm vibe, for how much you care and for how genuine and kind of a person you are even though you convince yourself you're not. Even if you have these thoughts that make you think you are unkind, the fact that you don't say it because it will hurt the other person is all that's needed to be kind. Even the kindest people have the worst thoughts, it's just what they decided to do with these thoughts. Things have been tough between us. I am trying everyday to do all I can to not make the same mistakes and new ones for that matter. You are so patient and kind with me and I appreciate that so much. For the past week, I've put myself in your shoes and experienced certain aspects of our relationship from your perspective. Not that I didn't before, but I've come to appreciate and value of you gicing your firsts to me so much more. When you used to say that you lost that bragging rights about not being with anyone physically like that, I used to take offense to it and not understand what you actually meant. But I get it now. You're not trying to bring me down by saying that, it's just a big deal because it was something that was a part of your identity and you lost it. And instead of cherishing and understanding, I took it to mean that you were regretting everything you did with me. I've had a lot more of these realizations because I've been reliving a lot since we started and I concluded so much. I love you so much and you really do put up with so much. I will keep working on learning you inside out and always considering you in any situation I'm in no matter how small. I will always think of you first and then commit the action. I will make you look good and make you proud to be with me. When you tell Sria or anyone anything, I'll make sure to make you pause and think for a long time when they ask you if there's anything that I've done or I am that you dislike. I know my words are just words right now, but I am telling you I will and it all starts with me being comfortable and secure in myself. I'll be the best for you. There's no one better. I am made for you. I love you so much, you will be all my lasts. \n Yours forever, Anurag. </p>";
